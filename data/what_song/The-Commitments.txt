Mustang Sally
Try a Little Tenderness
Take Me to the River
Chain of Fools
The Dark End of the Street
In the Midnight Hour
I Can't Stand the Rain
I Never Loved a Man
Land of a Thousand Dances
Nowhere to Run
Bring It On Home to Me
Slip Away
Mr. Pitiful
Treat Her Right
Bye Bye Baby
Hard to Handle
I Thank You
Show Me
That's the Way Love Is
Grits Ain't Groceries
Too Many Fish In the Sea
Saved
Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa (Sad Song)
Mustang Sally
