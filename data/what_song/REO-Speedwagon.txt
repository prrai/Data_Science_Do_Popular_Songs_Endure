Can't Fight This Feeling
Can't Fight This Feeling
Back On The Road Again
Ridin' The Storm Out
Keep On Loving You
Keep On Loving You
Keep On Loving You
Can't Fight This Feeling
Can't Fight This Feeling
Can't Fight This Feeling
Can't Fight This Feeling
Wherever You're Goin' (It's Alright)
Keep On Loving You
Keep On Loving You
Can't Fight This Feeling
Roll With the Changes
Time for Me to Fly
Time for Me to Fly
Do You Know Where Your Woman Is Tonight
Roll With the Changes
Roll With the Changes
Can't Fight This Feeling
Live Every Moment
Keep On Loving You
Can't Fight This Feeling
