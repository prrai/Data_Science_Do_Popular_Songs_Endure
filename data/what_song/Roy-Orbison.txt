Oh Pretty Woman
Oh, Pretty Woman

Life Fades Away

Crying
Oh, Pretty Woman
Only the Lonely (Know the Way I Feel)
Beautiful Dreamer
In Dreams
She's a Mystery to Me
There Won't Be Many Coming Home
You Got It
Bye Bye Love
In Dreams
In Dreams
Blue Bayou
Blue Bayou
In Dreams
Crying
Let's Make a Memory
Blue Bayou
