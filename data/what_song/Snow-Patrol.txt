Give Me Strength
New York
The Weight Of Love
Open Your Eyes
Crack The Shutters
Somewhere A Clock Is Ticking
Shut Your Eyes
Open Your Eyes
How To Be Dead
Take Back The City
Somewhere A Clock Is Ticking
Chasing Cars
Open Your Eyes
Make This Go On Forever
The Planets Bend Between Us
New York
Called Out In The Dark
The Weight Of Love
Run
Tiny Little Fractures
Spitting Games
Run
How To Be Dead
Chasing Cars
The Lightning Strike
How To Be Dead
You Could Be Happy
Signal Fire
You're All I Have
Shut Your Eyes
Open Your Eyes
You're All I Have
Chasing Cars
Just Say Yes
When Love Breaks Down
Just Say Yes
How to Be Dead
I Won't Let You Go
Tell Me It's Ok
I Wear Your Heart on My Sleeve
Before I Go
