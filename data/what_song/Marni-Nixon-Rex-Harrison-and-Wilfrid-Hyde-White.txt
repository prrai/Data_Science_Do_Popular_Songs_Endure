Overture
Why Can't the English?
Wouldn't It Be Loverly
The Flowermarket
I'm an Ordinary Man
With a Little Bit of Luck
Just You Wait
Servants' Chorus
Ascot Gavotte
Ascot Gavotte (Reprise)
The Rain In Spain
I Could Have Danced All Night
On the Street Where You Live
Intermission
The Transylvanian March
The Embassy Waltz
You Did It
Just You Wait (Reprise)
On the Street Where You Live (Reprise)
Show Me
The Flowermarket
Get Me to the Church On Time
A Hymn to Him
Without You
I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face
End Titles
Exit Music
