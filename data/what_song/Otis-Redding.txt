Merry Christmas Baby
Respect
Pain In My Heart
I Love You More Than Words Can Say
These Arms of Mine
Mr. Pitiful
Try a Little Tenderness
(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay
I've Got Dreams to Remember
I've Been Loving You Too Long
You Don't Miss Your Water
My Lover's Prayer
I've Got Dreams to Remember
I've Been Loving You Too Long
That's How Strong My Love Is
I've Got Dreams to Remember
I've Been Loving You Too Long
White Christmas
(Sittin' On) The Dock of The Bay
Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa (Sad Song)
Down In The Valley
Cigarettes and Coffee
Sittin On The Dock Of The Bay
These Arms of Mine
Dreams to Remember
These Arms of Mine
Try a Little Tenderness
Love Man
These Arms of Mine
For Your Precious Love
These Arms of Mine
Ole Man Trouble
Ole Man Trouble
These Arms of Mine
These Arms of Mine
